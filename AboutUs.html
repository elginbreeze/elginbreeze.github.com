                  <p>A passion for restoring historic homes and gardens, coupled with a strong sense of neighborhood and  love of community  was the common bond that built our friendship and began Garden Fancies.</p>
                  <p>Many years ago,while volunteering for our church's yearly Mother's Day perennial plant sale, we had the opportunity to visit some of the finest gardens and learn from some of the most expert gardeners in the area.  While thinning plants from their yards for the plant sale, we learned an appreciation of the rare and unusual, got exposed to many different styles of gardens, and forged many wonderful friendships with fellow gardeners in the community.</p>
                  <p>Although the yearly church plant sale eventually ended, we decided to continue hosting our own yearly sale of plants dug from our own perennial beds, now overflowing from years of plant collecting. Plus, we simply had to have an excuse to continue to have our yearly "reunion with our gardening friends!</p>
                  <p>Over the years, we have grown to be known as the "plant ladies"- adopting orphan plants, foraging for discarded plastic pots, but especially for offering  top quality plants at very reasonable prices. Along the way, we added statuary and other garden art to address our fellow gardeners' desire to make their gardens "fancier"- thus began Garden Fancies.</p>
                  <p>Today, Garden Fancies is more than just a one-day garden festival . but our philosophy  of fostering a  connection between gardeners  to share their stories and love of the art of gardening continues to be our mission.</p>
